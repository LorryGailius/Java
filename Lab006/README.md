# GUI using THREADS
- Create an application which reads data from a file.
- The read file data must be displayed in a table.
Use threads to read one line at a time (the following data per row: id, first_name, last_name, email, imagelink, ip_address).     
- The data of the single line must be saved in a separate file (the filename must be the first three letters of the firstname and lastname and the last digits of the IP (after the last dot). 
- When the file is created we must delete the record from the table.
- We have to create another table where we can see the list of already completed tasks (data must be updated in real-time).
- We have the possibility to delete a file already created. The file is deleted when we click delete on a specific entry in the completed works table. 
- Once a job has been deleted it should be visible in another table where the records are being read.
- We need to be able to delete all jobs with one click.
